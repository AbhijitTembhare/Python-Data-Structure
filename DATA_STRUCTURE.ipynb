        "1. **What are data structures, and why are they important?**  \n",
        "   Data structures are ways to organize and store data efficiently. They are important because they enable efficient data access, modification, and management, improving program performance.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.**  \n",
        "   Mutable types (e.g., lists, dictionaries) can be modified after creation, while immutable types (e.g., tuples, strings) cannot be changed once assigned.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?**  \n",
        "   Lists are mutable, slower, and use more memory, while tuples are immutable, faster, and consume less memory.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Describe how dictionaries store data.**  \n",
        "   Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs using a hash table, enabling fast lookups and modifications.  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?**  \n",
        "   Sets remove duplicate values automatically and offer faster membership tests compared to lists.  \n",
        "\n",
        "6. **What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?**  \n",
        "   A string is an immutable sequence of characters, whereas a list is mutable and can hold elements of different data types.  \n",
        "\n",
        "7. **How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?**  \n",
        "   Tuples are immutable, preventing accidental modification and ensuring data remains unchanged.  \n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?**  \n",
        "   A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hashing function, which is how Python dictionaries store data efficiently.  \n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Can lists contain different data types in Python?**  \n",
        "   Yes, lists in Python can store elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, and objects.  \n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Explain why strings are immutable in Python.**  \n",
        "   Strings are immutable to enhance security, optimize memory usage, and allow efficient string interning.  \n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?**  \n",
        "   Dictionaries provide faster lookups using keys, making them ideal for tasks requiring quick data retrieval.  \n",
        "\n",
        "12. **How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?**  \n",
        "   Sets automatically remove duplicate values, ensuring all elements are unique.  \n",
        "\n",
        "13. **Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.**  \n",
        "   Tuples are preferable for storing fixed data like database records or function return values that shouldn't be modified.  \n",
        "\n",
        "14. **How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?**  \n",
        "   In lists, it checks for the presence of a value, while in dictionaries, it checks for the presence of a key.  \n",
        "\n",
        "15. **Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.**  \n",
        "   No, tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.  \n",
        "\n",
        "16. **What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?**  \n",
        "   A nested dictionary is a dictionary within another dictionary, useful for storing hierarchical data like employee records.  \n",
        "\n",
        "17. **Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.**  \n",
        "   Accessing elements in a dictionary has an average time complexity of O(1) due to hash table indexing.  \n",
        "\n",
        "18. **In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?**  \n",
        "   Lists are preferred when order matters, or when storing sequential data without requiring key-value lookups.  \n",
        "\n",
        "19. **Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?**  \n",
        "   Before Python 3.7, dictionaries were unordered because they relied on hash tables; this meant data retrieval was not in insertion order.  \n",
        "\n",
        "20. **Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.**  \n",
        "   Lists retrieve elements by index, requiring O(n) for searching, while dictionaries use key-based lookups, providing O(1) retrieval."
